###  This Project is build using HTML & CSS 

<b> Note: </b>  This Project is Responisive but not to all the devices. 
 -In our Project the Media Query Targets  the particular viewport ranges in this Project it is 720px and below that.

### There are lot of things which i learn by doing this Project.
 
1. Z-index Property : <br/>
     - We used Z-index Property for our Navigation Bar and give it a Position fixed so that when we scroll down the page the navigation bar remain on the screen and will Overlap all the elements.


        - The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
        - z-index only works on positioned elements.
        - Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
        - Use Z Index if you need to put a background element below a container. You can easily place the background under every element by giving it a negative Z Index like below:

          ```
          #background
          {
            z-index: -1;
          }
          ```
        

2.<b> Responsive Web Design </b>: 
      <br/>
   - responsive web design will able to adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
   - <b>Media Queries</b> <br/>
In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
      Example:-
      ```
      /* Viewports between 320px and 480px wide */
          
      @media only screen and (min-device-width:320px) and (max-device-width: 480px) 
      {
      .card {
              background: #bada55;
            } 
      }
      ```

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
